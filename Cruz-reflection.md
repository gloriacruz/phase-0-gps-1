# Release 7

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I guess the commit and pull were the most complicated to me.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Both the commit and the pull are clear now. Also, I got more information about why branches are useful and how to solve merge conflicts. I also got to see the Version Control in action with a team of > 1 person.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I remember 2 in particular: Can a push include code for 2 or more commits? and when there is a merge conflict, who is the appropriate person to solve and consolidate the changes?.

* What still confuses you about Git?
I guess I'm curious to see how everything plays out in a development environment with a large team. There also some commands that I need to learn.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was very helpful, it was like practice, mini-test, hands-on lesson and get to know the team, all in one.
